# DELIVERABLE 1: When the app starts, I can see all plants.

## Step 1:
  - [x] Initialize a state to hold the list of plants
  - [x] Use fetch to make a GET request for the plants and update the state with the response
        (Do all this inside of a useEffect)
## STEP 2:
  - [x] Pass the state of plants through to the plant list as a prop
  - [x] (In the PlantList component) Iterate through the plants, and render one PlantCard for each plant


# DELIVERABLE 2: I can add a new plant to the page by submitting the form.

## Step 1: Make the NewPlantForm into a controlled component
  - [x] Need a formData state to hold the data
  - [x] Connect the formData state to the inputs (make the input value the corresponding formData attribute)
  - [x] Need onChange event handlers to update the state as inputs are changed
